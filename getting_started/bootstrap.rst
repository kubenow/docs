Deploy KubeNow on a host cloud
==============================
The following steps are slightly different for each host cloud. Here you find a section for each of the supported providers.

Deploy on OpenStack
-------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we assume that:

- You have downloaded and sourced the OpenStack RC file for your tenancy: ``source project-openrc.sh`` (https://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli-set-environment-variables-using-openstack-rc.html#download-and-source-the-openstack-rc-file)
- You have a floating IP quota that allows to allocate at least one public IP

Deployment configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First we need to initialize a deploy configuration directory by running::

  kn init openstack my_deployment

The configuration directory contains a new SSH key pair for your deployments, and a `Terraform <http://terraform.io/>`_ configuration template that we need to fill in.

Locate into ``my_deployment`` :

  cd my_deployment

In the configuration file ``config.tfvars`` you will need to set at least:

**Cluster configuration**

- **cluster_prefix**: every resource in your tenancy will be named with this prefix
- **floating_ip_pool**: a floating IP pool label
- **external_network_uuid**: the uuid of the external network in the OpenStack tenancy

If you are wondering where you can get ``floating_ip_pool`` and ``external_network_uuid``, then one way is to inquiry your OpenStack settings by running::

  kn openstack network list

Depending on your tenancy settings you should get a similar output::

  +--------------------------------------+----------------+...
  | ID                                   | Label          |...
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+...
  | 5f274562-89b6-4ab2-a18f-94b159b0b85d | internal       |...
  | d9384930-baa5-422b-8657-1d42fb54f89c | net_external   |...
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+...

Thus in this specific case the above mentioned fields will be set as it follows::

  floating_ip_pool = "net_external"
  external_network_uuid = "d9384930-baa5-422b-8657-1d42fb54f89c"


**Master configuration**

  - **master_flavor**: an instance flavor for the master
  - **master_extra_disk_size** **[optional]**: adds an extra disk with specified size to the node

**Node configuration**

  - **node_count**: number of Kubernetes nodes to be created (no floating IP is needed for these nodes)
  - **node_flavor**: an instance flavor name for the Kubernetes nodes
  - **node_extra_disk_size** **[optional]**: adds an extra disk with specified size to the node
  - **node_assign_floating_ip** **[optional]**: adds a floating ip to this node


If you are wondering yet again where you can fetch correct flavor label names then no worries, you are not being a stranger here. The openstack command-line interface will come in handy. Just run the following command::

  kn openstack flavor list

Depending on your tenancy settings you should get a similar output::

    +--------+------------+...
    | ID     | Name       |...
    +--------+------------+...
    | 8c7ef1 | ssc.tiny   |...
    | 8d7ef2 | ssc.small  |...
    | 8e7ef3 | ssc.medium |...
    | 8f7ef4 | ssc.large  |...
    | 8g7ef5 | ssc.xlarge |...
    +--------+------------+...

You may want to select the favor according to much resources you'd like to allocate. E.g.::

    master_flavor = "ssc.medium"
    node_flavor = "ssc.large"

Deploy KubeNow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you are done with your settings you are ready deploy your cluster running::

  kn apply

The first time you are going to deploy it will take longer, since the KubeNow image needs to be imported. Future deployments will be considerably faster, since the image will be already present in your user space.

To check that your cluster is up and running you can run::

  kn kubectl get nodes

As long as you are in the ``my_deployment`` directory you can use ``kubectl`` over SSH to control Kubernetes. If you want to open an interactive SSH terminal onto the master then you can use the ``kn ssh`` command::

  kn ssh

If everything went well, now you are ready to :doc:`deploy your first application <first-app>`.

Deploy on Google Cloud (GCE)
----------------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we assume that:

- You have enabled the Google Compute Engine API: API Manager > Library > Compute Engine API > Enable
- You have created and downloaded a service account file for your GCE project: Api manager > Credentials > Create credentials > Service account key

Deployment configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First we need to initialize a deploy configuration directory by running::

  kn init gce my_deployment

The configuration directory contains a new SSH key pair for your deployments, and a `Terraform <http://terraform.io/>`_ configuration template that we need to fill in.

Locate into ``my_deployment`` :

  cd my_deployment

In the configuration file ``config.tfvars`` you will need to set at least:

**Cluster configuration**

- **cluster_prefix**: every resource in your project will be named with this prefix (the name must match ``(?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)``, e.g. "kubenow")

**Google credentials**

- **gce_project**: your project id
- **gce_zone**: some GCE zone (e.g. ``europe-west1-b``)

**Master configuration**

- **master_flavor**: an instance flavor for the master (e.g. ``n1-standard-2``)
- **master_disk_size**: master disk size in GB

**Node configuration**

- **node_count**: number of Kubernetes nodes to be created
- **node_flavor**: an instance flavor for the Kubernetes nodes (e.g. ``n1-standard-2``)
- **node_disk_size**: nodes disk size in GB

In addition, when deploying on GCE you need to copy your service account file in the deployment configuration directory::

  # assuming that you are in my_deployment
  cp /path/to/service-account.json ./
